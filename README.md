# path_planning
offline path planners (RRT, RRT*, visibility gprahs, bug) ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adarkhorse/path_planning.svg?branch=master)


RRT and RRT* - Rapidly Exploring Random Trees

Visibility Graphs - 

Bug - A bug flood algorithm for obstacle rich environment

A camparison between some offline path planning algorithms. Implmentation is done in ROS and visulization is done using RVIZ.
