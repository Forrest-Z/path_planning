# path_planning
offline path planners (RRT, RRT*, visibility gprahs, bug) 

RRT and RRT* - Rapidly Exploring Random Trees

Visibility Graphs - Implementation of Visibility graph is O(n^3).

Bug - A bug flood algorithm for obstacle rich environment

A camparison between some offline path planning algorithms. Implmentation is done in ROS and visulization is done using RVIZ. 



**Update:** Working on a newer implementation of the bug_flood.
